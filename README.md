# vision-mfg

Welcome. I am Chloe. Depending on what you are looking at and looking for this could either be alright, or very bad. :P 
My main interest lately has been vision systems and automating data annotation for said vision systems. I like manufacturing, so most of this will be (hopefully) applied there. 

Folders 01_mtconnect_parser and 02_mtconnect_camera_coordinates contain microprojects with their own individual readme.md(s). These projects relate directly to manufacturing and robotics environments. 

SSL-data-annotation also includes its own readme.md, but with a more general use-case, though, still developed because of and for manufacturing environments.
